# Contributing
I'm open for other people's ideas, help, debugging or any other form of collaboration
even if you're just bored like me.

#### If you just want to make some kind of joke version of terminal, then just make your own fork or clone and keep it for yourself.
But anyway, if you want to improve that thing for some reason, then feel free to join.
Might be fun.

#### Report bugs here: https://github.com/BPPL0806/PythonTerminalSimulator/issues.
